# Getting Started {.unnumbered}

## Setup

The LANDFIRE API requires an email address. Set it via environment variable:

```julia
ENV["LANDFIRE_EMAIL"] = "your@email.com"
```

Consider adding this to `~/.julia/config/startup.jl` for persistence.

## Basic Usage

```julia
using Landfire

# Check that API is running
Landfire.healthcheck()

# Browse available products
prods = Landfire.products()                    # All latest products
prods = Landfire.products(theme="Fuel")        # Filter by theme
prods = Landfire.products(layer="FBFM13")      # Filter by layer name

# Create a Dataset for an area of interest
data = Landfire.Dataset(prods, "-105.5 39.5 -105.0 40.0")  # xmin ymin xmax ymax

# Download and extract (results are cached)
tif_file = get(data)

# List all extracted files
Landfire.files(data)

# Get attribute table for a layer
table = Landfire.attribute_table("FBFM13")
```
